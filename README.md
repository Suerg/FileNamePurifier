FileNamePurifier
================

FileNamePurifier, a Python port of my earlier project FileNameCleaner for Objective-C which was in turn a port of FileNameCleanser for C#. It is mainly intended to clean media file names.

A Mac OS X binary is available here: https://mega.co.nz/#!qdFFgBiQ!OT5b2GR3mr6Tc9YuPQyH5Xq1t3QUU3Ze8Xtv8GcYocs
